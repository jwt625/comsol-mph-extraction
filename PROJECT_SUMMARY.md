# COMSOL MPH Extraction Project Summary

## 📋 Project Overview
**Goal**: Create high-quality fine-tuning datasets from COMSOL modeling bundles (PDF instructions + .m scripts + metadata) for training AI models on COMSOL simulation workflows.

## 🏗️ Architecture Evolution

### Original Problem
- `extract_and_align.py` had poor alignment between PDF instructions and code blocks
- Semantic mismatch: PDF describes "what to do", code shows "how to do it" 
- 97% of code segments were being ignored (only processed first 10 of 381 segments)

### Solution: Code-First LLM-Assisted Pipeline
**Location**: `llm_assisted_alignment.py`

**4-Stage Approach**:
1. **Code Analysis**: LLM analyzes .m scripts to understand what code actually does (ground truth)
2. **PDF Extraction**: Extract instructional content for pedagogical context  
3. **Semantic Matching**: Match code descriptions to PDF sections using COMSOL IDs and keywords
4. **Enhanced Examples**: Combine code understanding with PDF pedagogy for training data

## 🔧 Technical Setup

### Environment
- **API Provider**: Lambda AI endpoint at `https://api.lambda.ai/v1`
- **API Key**: `LLM_API_KEY` environment variable
- **Dependencies**: `openai`, `anthropic`, `pdfminer.six` in `comsol-env` virtual environment

### Model Selection (Tested)
- **Primary**: `hermes3-405b` (405B parameters, best reasoning)
- **Alternatives**: `qwen25-coder-32b-instruct`, `llama3.3-70b-instruct-fp8`

## ⚡ Performance Issues Identified

### Current Bottlenecks
1. **Sequential Processing**: Making LLM calls one by one (slow)
2. **Large Model**: `hermes3-405b` is powerful but slow
3. **Network Latency**: Each API call has round-trip time
4. **Volume**: 381 code segments per model = many API calls

### Performance Analysis Tool
**Created**: `test_performance.py` - Comprehensive benchmarking suite that tests:
- Sequential vs parallel processing
- Different model speeds
- Batch processing (multiple segments per call)
- Calls per second measurement

## 🚀 Optimization Strategies

### Hybrid Processing Approach (Current Implementation)
- **LLM Analysis**: First 50 segments (most critical) 
- **Pattern-Based**: Remaining segments using regex + context
- **Complete Coverage**: Every single code segment gets processed
- **Fallback Methods**: Multiple strategies when LLM fails

### Potential Optimizations (Not Yet Implemented)
1. **Parallel Processing**: Use ThreadPoolExecutor with 3-5 workers
2. **Faster Models**: Switch to `llama3.3-70b-instruct-fp8` for speed
3. **Batch Processing**: Analyze 5-10 segments per LLM call
4. **Reduced Tokens**: Lower max_tokens for faster responses

## 🔍 Current Status

### ✅ Completed
- LLM pipeline working end-to-end
- Processing ALL 381 code segments (not just 10)
- Intelligent fallbacks for failed LLM calls
- Complete test coverage
- Comprehensive documentation

### ⚠️ Known Issues
- **Performance**: Sequential LLM calls are slow (need performance testing)
- **Cost**: Many API calls for large models
- **Timeouts**: Some LLM calls fail due to network issues

### 🎯 Next Steps (Ready to Execute)
1. **Run Performance Analysis**: Execute `test_performance.py` to measure exact call speeds
2. **Implement Parallel Processing**: Add ThreadPoolExecutor to pipeline
3. **Optimize Model Selection**: Use fastest model that maintains quality
4. **Add Batch Processing**: Process multiple segments per LLM call
5. **Scale Testing**: Process multiple models to validate improvements

## 💡 Key Innovation
**Code-First Approach**: Instead of trying to match vague PDF instructions to complex code, we:
1. Let LLM understand what the code actually does (ground truth)
2. Use PDF for pedagogical context and explanations
3. Create enhanced training examples that combine both

This ensures every line of code gets properly documented and included in training data.

## 🔗 Environment Variables Needed
```bash
export LLM_API_KEY="your_lambda_ai_key"
export LLM_API_BASE="https://api.lambda.ai/v1"
```

## 📊 Scale
- **Models**: ~20+ COMSOL model directories
- **Code Segments**: ~300-400 per model  
- **Total Volume**: ~8,000+ training examples when fully processed

## 🛠️ Quick Start Commands

### Activate Environment
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/GitHub/comsol-mph-extraction
source comsol-env/bin/activate
```

### Test Performance (Recommended First Step)
```bash
python test_performance.py
```

### Process Single Model (Testing)
```bash
python llm_assisted_alignment.py --mphs_dir mphs --max_models 1
```

### Process All Models

## 📈 Performance Expectations
- **Current**: ~1-3 calls/second (sequential, large model)
- **Optimized Target**: ~10-20 calls/second (parallel, faster model)
- **Processing Time**: ~20-60 minutes per model (depends on optimizations)

The project is ready for performance optimization and scaling to process the complete dataset efficiently.
